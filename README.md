üçµ A Ren'Py murder mystery about the death of a young student, and the reappearance of a mysterious matcha murderer. Is this the case of the past being revived, or someone new taking on a dangerous name? üçµ

This project was created for the University of Waterloo's 2022 **Hack the North!** The goal of this story was to follow the guidance of keynote speaker and musician **will.i.am**, who inspired us with his speech on the unity between tech and art‚Äî be it musical, visual, or literary.
